# GitHub User Analyzer Agent

This example demonstrates how to create a specialized AI agent that analyzes GitHub user activity and generates comprehensive reports. The agent uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) tool to gather information about users, repositories, and contributions.

## What This Agent Does

The GitHub Analyzer Agent is designed to:
- Analyze any GitHub user's profile and activity
- Generate detailed reports on repositories, contributions, and coding patterns
- Provide insights into a user's technologies, languages, and project involvement
- Answer follow-up questions about the analyzed user

## Setup

1. **Install GitHub CLI**: Make sure you have `gh` CLI installed and authenticated:
   ```bash
   # Install gh CLI (if not already installed)
   brew install gh  # macOS
   # or follow: https://cli.github.com/
   
   # Authenticate with GitHub
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**: Copy and edit the `.env` file if you need API keys for premium models:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys (optional)
   ```

3. **Run the Agent**: Use `uv run` to execute the analyzer:
   ```bash
   uv run github_analyzer.py <github_username>
   ```

## Example Session

Here's a short session analyzing the user `the-gigi`:

```bash
$ uv run github_analyzer.py the-gigi

## Configuration

The agent uses a minimal configuration that includes only the GitHub CLI MCP tool:

```json
{
  "default_model_id": "devstral:24b",
  "mcp_tools_dirs": ["${HOME}/git/ai-six/py/backend/mcp_tools"],
  "memory_dir": "${HOME}/git/ai-six/memory/github-analyzer",
  "checkpoint_interval": 3,
  "provider_config": {
    "ollama": {
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder:32b"
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Agent Initialization**: Creates an AI agent with a specialized system prompt for GitHub analysis
2. **GitHub CLI Integration**: Uses the `gh` MCP tool to execute GitHub CLI commands
3. **Structured Analysis**: Follows a systematic approach to gather user information
4. **Interactive Session**: Allows follow-up questions for deeper analysis
5. **Memory Persistence**: Maintains conversation history for context

## Customization

You can modify the agent's behavior by:
- Editing the system prompt in `github_analyzer.py`
- Changing the analysis focus areas
- Adding additional tools to the configuration
- Modifying the output format and structure

This example demonstrates how to create domain-specific AI agents that leverage command-line tools for specialized analysis tasks.
