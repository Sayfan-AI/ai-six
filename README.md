# AI-6
Agentic AI focused on ubiquitous tool using.

The current implementation is in Python. check out the [py](py/README.MD) directory.

There may be implementations in other languages too, in the near future.

See this [link](https://deepwiki.com/Sayfan-AI/ai-six) for a super-deep dive into the project.

# LLM Access

Obviously, it delegates all the heavy lifting to an LLM provider. At the moment it is OpenAI-compatible or Ollama local models.

For OpenAI-compatible LLM providers the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set.

# Installation & Usage

## Option 1: Install from PyPI (Easiest)

```bash
pip install ai-six

# Use in Python code
from ai_six.agent import Agent
```

## Option 2: Development Setup

Using uv (recommended for development):

```bash
cd py/
uv sync --dev
# Run CLI frontend
uv run python -m frontend.cli.ai6 --help
```

## Option 3: Traditional Development Setup

After you activate the virtualenv and install the dependencies, you can run an AI-6 frontend using the startup script (`ai6.sh`).

**Example â€” Run the CLI frontend:**

```
./ai6.sh cli
```

## Building and Publishing the Package

To build the Python package for distribution:

```bash
cd py/
uv build
```

This creates distribution files in `py/dist/`:
- `ai_six-*.whl` (wheel distribution)
- `ai_six-*.tar.gz` (source distribution)

To publish to PyPI:
1. Create account at [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org)
2. Generate API token in PyPI account settings
3. Configure authentication:
   ```bash
   uv publish --token <your-api-token>
   ```
   Or set environment variable: `export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN=<your-token>`
