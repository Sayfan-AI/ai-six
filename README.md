The current implementation is in Python. check out the [py](py/README.MD) directory.

There may be implementations in other languages too, in the near future.

See this [link](https://deepwiki.com/Sayfan-AI/ai-six) for a super-deep dive into the project.

# LLM Access

It expects an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set.

# Usage

After you activate the virtualenv and install the dependencies

You can the run AI-6 CLI using the following command:

```
