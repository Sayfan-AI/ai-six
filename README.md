# AI-6
Agentic AI focused on ubiquitous tool using.

The current implementation is in Python. check out the [py](py/README.MD) directory.

There may be implementations in other languages too, in the near future.

# LLM Access

Obviously, it delegates all the heavy lifting to an LLM provider. At the moment it is OpenAI.

It expects an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set.

# Usage

After you activate the virtualenv and install the dependencies

You can the run AI-6 CLI using the following command:

```
./ai6.sh
```
